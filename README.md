# Blurb

A top down shooter based on the game Enter the Gungeon. You are stuck within the terminal, which manifests as a harsh dungeon. You will first find the two NPC's which will help you learn how to play. When they deem you are ready, you will be granted passage to bash the dungeon. You will traverse through rooms, defeat enemies, unlock new weapons, and utilize your in-game terminal to do all of this. In order to successfully fight the enemies you will need to operate your weapons and player with various bash commands. Additionally, you will face the end boss which will be the final test of your command knowlege, and game sense. Ultimately the objective of the game is to escape the terminal and learn some bash commands along the way.
